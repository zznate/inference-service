# Current Providers
The following providers are currently supported:

- [OpenAI Provider](docs/openai-provider.md)
- [LM Studio Provider](docs/lmstudio-provider.md)
- [Mock Provider](docs/mock-provider.md)

Note that since everything is configurable with the OpenAI provider (eg. the URL, endpoint, timeouts, etc), it is possible to use the OpenAI provider with any LLM that implements the OpenAI API.
